    <p>I am an aspiring software devleloper who comes from a sales background. I work at Aspire Health as a patient enrollment
      specialist and was just accepted into the accelerated program for becoming a supervisor at my current position. Prior
      to working at Aspire, I worked for a non profit called CenterStone and was a realtor. I would lke to be a front-end
      developer. I am looking for a career that keeps me on my toes and gives me the opportunity to grow and learn. I love
      that I am able to be creative and think critically. I enjoy solving problems. I have always been intrigued as to how
      much technology has changed and helps billions of peoples lives. Through virtual schools to connecting familys on social
      media technology is changing the way we think and do. I want to be a part of the industrial revoltuation and contribute
      to the change and evolution of the world.
